    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which the "turquastic" application (the "Application") operates and handles data. The Application is a personal, non-commercial automation project designed to retrieve image URLs from a specified Pinterest board and automatically publish them to designated social media platforms.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
    <p>The developer of this Application acts as the Data Controller. The developer is responsible for the limited data handling activities described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>The Application's core function is to facilitate automated content publishing. In order to perform this function, the Application requires access to a Pinterest board's content and authenticated access to various social media platforms.</p>
    
    <p>The Application collects and processes the following types of data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Image URLs:</strong> The Application retrieves the public URLs of images from a Pinterest board specified by the user. This data is used solely for the purpose of publishing content to social media.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Tokens:</strong> The Application uses secure access tokens for authentication with the APIs of Pinterest and other social media platforms. These tokens are stored as environment variables and are never exposed in the public codebase.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Application does <strong>NOT</strong> collect, store, or process any of the following personal data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User names, email addresses, or contact information.</li>
        <li>IP addresses, browser types, or device information.</li>
        <li>Sensitive personal data as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or other privacy laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>The processing of data is based on the legitimate interests of the developer, who operates the Application for personal, non-commercial purposes. Since the Application does not handle personal data, a formal consent mechanism is not required.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect the data we handle. All API keys and access tokens are managed securely and are not stored in a publicly accessible manner. The Application's code and dependencies are regularly reviewed for security vulnerabilities.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Application relies on the APIs of Pinterest and other social media platforms to function. Data is transferred to these platforms in accordance with their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party platforms.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>The Application does not retain any data beyond the immediate needs of the publishing process. Image URLs are used for the single purpose of content publication and are not stored in a database or any long-term storage medium by the Application itself.</p>

    <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
    <p>While the Application does not handle personal data, we commit to respecting data privacy rights. For any inquiries related to the Application's data handling, you can contact the developer.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our data handling practices.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>For any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer through appropriate channels.</p>
